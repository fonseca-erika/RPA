# Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

Robotic process automation (or RPA) is a form of business process automation technology based on metaphorical software robots (bots) or on artificial intelligence (AI)/digital workers.

This definition sounds confusing but the idea is quite simple the first element that we have to think is business process, that by definition is a series of actions that you take in order, under a set of predefined rules, to achieve a result. Some tasks in a process are dull, because they are repetitive and usually have to be done by humans only because of systems' inefficiency. The automation means that robots are programmed to perform the same operations that would be done by a human.

The first question that came to my mind when I first heard about RPA was: why don't we try to simplify processes instead of programming robots to do administrative tasks? And it didn't take me much time to realize that the speed that we need in business management is not always followed by advances in IT inside the organizations, and you might say that I'm crazy. But I'm not, many companies are slaves of their software suppliers, suffering to get improvements, because their demands go to a backlog and are prioritized either if it's a commom requierement from other clients or we pay to have an additional feature. In my opinion, that's the reason for RPA being developed to solve this gap with low investment.

At some point you might be thinking that RPA is coming to replace people, and in my opinion this is not the case! It comes to reduce the overload of some employees giving them time to work on projects to improve efficiency.

There are many solutions available at the market, including some open source ones. Do not hesitate searching for this technology, because I'm confident that your company can take advantage of its benefits in a short period of time.
